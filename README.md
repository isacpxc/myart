# myart

myart is my personal project for a client-based application to interact with smart contracts.

Essencially, the idea here is a simple marketplace to trade NFTs (AI-generated personal images) with the MATK token.

## principal topics

* MATK token: internal token for marketing NFTs.

* NFT: image + metadata.

* The metadata of the images will be stored in [IPFS network](https://ipfs.tech/).

* Login with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

* Use of [Sepolia](https://sepolia.dev/) testnet for now (maybe polygon latter).

* [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) providing connection between frontend and the smartcontracts.

* [Helia](https://helia.io/) Provides connection with IPFS network.
